        <h1>About Photography</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Photography</strong> is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording
            light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
            material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
            photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
            recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1] <br>

            Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the
            light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this
            produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image
            file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent
            image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on
            the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is
            traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by
            using an enlarger or by contact printing.

        <h1>The Evolution of Photography</h1>
        <p>
            It started with a box until about 190 years ago when Joseph Nicephore Niepce produced what is believed to be
            the oldest surviving photograph from a window of his estate in Le Gras in the Burgundy region of France.
            We’ll talk more about Joe in just a little bit. However, the beginnings of photography reach back further
            than that… much, much, much further back. We’re talking about an entirely different millennium.<br>

            Let’s stop here for just a moment in order to admit that as with many monumental discoveries and inventions
            there are protestations and controversies surrounding some of the events that will be recounted here. Still,
            I will always do everything I can to at least mention all involved parties in order to give credit where it
            is most certainly due.<br>
            It all most likely began in China with an alarmingly simple apparatus called the “camera obscura”. It’s name
            is derived from Latin which means “dark chamber” (how great is that?) and we can trace back references to
            this device as as the fourth century BCE. A camera obscura is a box of virtually any size which has a hole
            of small diameter in one side which allows light to pass. The light then casts itself on the inside of the
            box thus making an inverted image.<br>
