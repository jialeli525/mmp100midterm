        <h1>Robert Frank</h1>
        <p>
            There was never a more prolific photographer than Robert Frank. From 1941, he worked as a commercial
            photographer in Zurich, Basel and Geneva.
            <br>
            In 1947, he found a job as a fashion photographer in the US. He used his 35mm Leica, unconventional at the
            time. Between 1950 and ’59 he turned his attention to street photography and photojournalism.

            <br>
            This is where he became most famous. The Guggenheim Fellowship allowed him to travel the country, resulting
            in his most famous work: The Americans.
            <br>
            He worked closely to Walker Evans and became one of the world’s most famous street photographers. He
            completed his visuals with text, written straight onto the negatives and prints.

        <h1>Graciela Iturbide</h1>
        <p>
            Born in Mexico City, Graciela Iturbide studied filmmaking at the Centro Universitario de Estudios
            Cinematográficos between 1969 and 1972, and worked as an assistant to photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who
            stimulated her interest in photography. She met to Henri Cartier-Bresson while traveling in Europe, and in
            1978, was one of the founding members of the Mexican Council of Photography. Besides Cartier-Bresson and
            Alvarez Bravo, Tina Modotti was in important influence on Iturbide. A major exhibition of her work,
            "External Encounters, Internal Imaginings: Photographs of Graciela Iturbide," was presented at the San
            Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in addition to retrospectives at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de
            Monterrey in Mexico, and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A monograph on her work, Graciela Iturbide:
            Images of the Spirit (1996), accompanied her Philadelphia show.

            <br>
            Iturbide's exquisite high-contrast black-and-white prints convey the starkness of life for many of her
            subjects. Traveling through Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, and the Mexican community of East Los
            Angeles, Iturbide documents the uneasy cohabitation of ancient cultural rituals and contemporary adaptations
            and interpretations. One of her particular interests has been the role of women, and since 1979 she has
            photographed the Zapotec Indians of Juchitán, Oaxaca, among whom women are commonly accorded places of
            power, and stereotypical gender roles are frequently subverted. Iturbide uses photography to try to
            understand Mexico in its totality, as a combination of indigenous practices, and imported and assimilated
            Catholic religious practices, and foreign economic trade.

        <h1>The Cemetary</h1>
        <p>
            This image is part of Graciela Iturbide’s series on the Juchitan indigenous culture, a major focus of her
            work from 1979 to 1988. Located in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the Juchitan is a matriarchal society in
            which women are in charge of everything from commerce to religious ceremonies. In The Cemetery, taken in
            1988, Iturbide depicts a woman carrying firewood through a cemetery made up of modest adobe tombs. Swallows
            circle around, filling the frame of the image. The scene is beautifully surreal, but also foreboding. The
            photographer creates her own reality, moving past Mexico’s Catholic traditions into Indian mysticism.
